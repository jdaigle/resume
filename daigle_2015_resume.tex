Promoted to a position to manage the entire software development team and software development life-cycle. Responsibilities include hiring new developers, mentoring both junior and senior developers, managing the backlog of product requirements and feature requests, managing the release schedule, leading code reviews and sprint planning meetings, and maintaining architectural consistency across all products and applications. Day-to-day activities require keeping developers productive by reducing the overhead of meetings and disruptions, as well as continuing to work side-by-side with developers to guide development of new features. Additionally tasked to work with technology partners to integrate their technology into Clearwave's, or vice versa.\newline{}\newline{}
\textbf{Achievements:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduced guidelines for client implementations team to build requirements and specifications for back-end integrations, such as HL7 and VPN connections.
\item Implemented a QA workflow that includes automated unit tests and full integration tests as well as manual acceptance and regression testing.
\item In charge of researching and building requirements for the servers and network equipment as part of a major data center upgrade. Tasked to execute the final migration of applications, databases, and network connections between data centers.
\item Architected a new application database schema, and designed and developed the data migration process. The goal of this project is to align the data model with business needs in terms of performance, scalability, and auditing.
\item Worked to normalize internal API design and data access patterns. Achieved a simpler back-end architecture that enables developers to implement new features faster and with fewer bugs.
\item Instrumented application level performance metrics to measure response times and to correlate with CPU and database query times. This lead to significant performance and scalability improvements in slow and high volume application operations.
\item Lead a team to design and build a new Provider Portal user interface targeting modern web browsers using a variety of modern web application techniques (e.g. HTML5, CSS, modern JavaScript, etc.)

Software development engineer working on patient registration solutions for healthcare providers. Primarily web applications hosted from a "cloud" data center. Back end solutions include EDI transactions for health insurance eligibility verification, payment processor integration, and bidirectional HL7 integrations for patient registration data flow to and from customer practice management systems.\newline{}\newline{}
\textbf{Achievements:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduced "agile" methodologies and TDD practices.
\item Worked on a team to design and implement a new HTML powered kiosk application to replace the aging Flash powered application. Server side frameworks and utilities include ASP.NET MVC and NHibernate. Client side scripting was handled through JQuery and various plug-ins.
\item Designed a custom "Kiosk Browser" using WinForms and an embedded IE Web Control that is installed on deployed kiosks and is used to interact with the kiosk web application.
\item Implemented kiosk hardware integrations including magnetic stripe readers (MSR) for payment and a camera for scanning driver's licenses and medical insurance cards.
\item Implemented a software solution to automatically scan and read information from driver's licenses and medical insurance cards through optical character recognition (OCR).
\item Redesigned Provider Portal application to use modern development strategies including ASP.NET MVC and client side scripting libraries such as JQuery.
\item Design and implemented a new EDI engine to integrate with healthcare insurance companies for electronic eligibility verification. The system is designed around NServiceBus utilizing a publish/subscribe architecture to scale to tens of thousands of transactions per day.

\cventry{2008--2009}{Software Engineer}{GeoFields, Inc.}{Atlanta, GA}{}{
{\url{http://www.geofields.com/}}\newline{}\newline{}
Enterprise software engineer for the industry leader in transmission pipeline data management software and services. Worked in multiple small teams that delivered a comprehensive enterprise software solution. Responsibilities included all aspects of the software process from design through development, quality assurance and release. Primarily utilized .NET, C\#, ASP.NET, ESRI ArcObjects, ESIR ArcDesktop, MS SQL Server, Oracle, and LLBLGen Pro.\newline{}\newline{}
\textbf{Achievements:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lead developer on the DataFrame Data Maintenance (DFDM) product. The product is built as an extension to ESRIâ€™s ArcMap application to maintain linearly-referenced transmission pipeline data in a customized geodatabase. The software consists of a .NET WinForms front end, written in C\#, with a shared back end library encapsulating the data access layer and domain object layer. Additionally, intense ArcObjects programming and business logic design was involved to build the user interface and interact with the data model. This product was demoed at the 2008 GeoFields User Conference.
\item Developer on the Facility Explorer (FE) product. An ASP.NET web application which utilizes ESRI mapping technology to dynamically display transmission pipeline assets, as well as a reporting tool. It relies heavily on custom JavaScript libraries to enable rich user interaction with the map. Also participated in support of a legacy classic ASP version of the software.
\item Lead the design and development of a large enterprise foundation code base to be reused by several other software applications. Much of the work included building a dynamic data access layer and business logic layer. Several newer .NET technologies were utilized including WCF and LINQ.
