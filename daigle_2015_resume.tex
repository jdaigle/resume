Promoted to a position to manage the entire software development team and software development life-cycle. Responsibilities include hiring new developers, mentoring both junior and senior developers, managing the backlog of product requirements and feature requests, managing the release schedule, leading code reviews and sprint planning meetings, and maintaining architectural consistency across all products and applications. Day-to-day activities require keeping developers productive by reducing the overhead of meetings and disruptions, as well as continuing to work side-by-side with developers to quickly implement new features on time. Additionally tasked to work with technology partners to integrate their technology into Clearwave's, or vice versa.
\newline{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduced guidelines for client implementations team to build requirements and specifications for back-end integrations, such as HL7 and VPN connections.
\item Implemented a QA workflow that includes automated unit tests and full integration tests as well as manual acceptance and regression testing.
\item In charge of researching and designing the requirements for the server and network equipment in a brand new data center. Tasked to execute the final migration of applications, database, and network connections between data centers.
\item Architected a new application database schema and designed/developed the data migration process. The goal this project is to more closely align the data model with business needs in terms of performance, scalability, and auditing.
\item Worked to normalize internal API and data access patterns. Achieved a simpler back-end application architecture that enables developers to implement new features faster and with fewer bugs.
\item Instrumented application level performance metrics to measure response times and correlate with CPU and database query times. This has lead to significant performance and scalability improvements in slower and high volume application operations.
\item Lead a team to design a new Provider Portal user interface built for modern web browsers using a variety of modern web application techniques including (i.e. HTML5, CSS, modern JavaScript, etc.)
\end{itemize}

Software development engineer working on patient registration solutions for healthcare providers. Primarily web based applications hosted from a "cloud" data center. Back end solutions include EDI transactions for health insurance eligibility verification, payment processor integration, and bidirectional HL7 integrations for patient registration data flow to and from customer practice management systems.
\newline{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduced "agile" methodologies and TDD practices that continue to flourish to this day.
\item Worked on a team to design and implement a new HTML-based Kiosk application to replace the aging Flash-based application. Server side frameworks and utilities include ASP.NET MVC and NHibernate. Client side scripting was handled through JQuery and various plug-ins.
\item Designed a custom "Kiosk Browser" using WinForms and embedded IE Web Control that is installed on deployed kiosks and is used to interact with the web application.
\item Implemented kiosk hardware integrations including magnetic stripe readers (MSR) for payment and a camera for scanning driver's licenses and medical insurance cards.
\item Implemented a software solution to automatically scan and read information from driver's licenses and medical insurance cards through optical character recognition (OCR).
\item Redesigned Provider Portal application to use modern development strategies including ASP.NET MVC and client side scripting libraries such as JQuery.
\item Design and implemented a new EDI engine to integrate with healthcare insurance companies for electronic eligibility verification. The system is designed around NServiceBus utilizing a publish/subscribe architecture to scale to millions of transactions per month.
\end{itemize}

Primarily utilized .NET, C\#, ASP.NET, ArcObjects, ArcDesktop, SQL Server, Oracle, LLBLGen.
\newline{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lead developer on the product DataFrame Data Maintenance (DFDM). The product is designed as an extension to ESRIâ€™s ArcMap application to maintain linearly-referenced transmission pipeline data in a customized geodatabase. The software consists of a .NET WinForms based front end, written in C\#, with a shared back end library containing the data access layer and domain object layer. Additionally, intense ArcObjects programming and business logic layer design was involved to build the user interface and interact with the data model. This product was demoed at the 2008 GeoFields User Conference.
\item Developer on the product Facility Explorer (FE). An ASP.NET based web application which utilizes ESRI mapping technology to dynamically display transmission pipeline assets, as well as a reporting tool. It relies heavily on custom JavaScript libraries to enable rich user interaction with the map. Also participated in support of a legacy ASP version of the software.
\item Lead in the design and development of a large enterprise foundation code base to be reused by several other software applications. Much of the work included building a dynamic data access layer and business logic layer. Several newer .NET technologies were utilized including WCF and LINQ.
